# MannAAdd2NumbersEndpoint

Project Description:
A Add2Numbers application that will take in two numbers from the user and output a string containing their sum

Instructions:
1. Download the files and put them in their own folder, open the folder in VS Code, start debugging (F5)
2. Navigate to "http://localhost:5110//Add2Numbers" for the default summation (you may need to change the port if it's different on your system > see debug console)
3. Append URL with two integers such as "http://localhost:5110/Add2Numbers/50/1000" for a customized summation
4. Have fun!

Peer reviewed by Reed Goodwin: Very well written program, the first one ive seen with any sort of validation. The way the validation was done was good, I like that the default math route is still there so you can test. ANd the UI is friendly!
